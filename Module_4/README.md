# Module 4 description

Now, you’ll explore fundamental data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and arrays. Lastly, you’ll learn about two of the most widely used and important Python tools for advanced data analysis: NumPy and pandas. 

## Lesson objectives
* Explain how to manipulate dataframes using techniques such as selecting and indexing, boolean masking, grouping and aggregating, and merging and joining
* Describe the main features and methods of core pandas data structures such as dataframes
* Describe the main features and methods of core NumPy data structures such as arrays and series
* Define Python tools such as libraries, packages, modules, and global variables
* Describe the main features and methods of built-in Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

# About the files

* This part of the repository contains an annotated guide (as a Jupyter Notebook) for the module about data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, arrays, vectors, and dataframes), as well as hands-on activities (and exemplars for those activities) about the use of the different data structures. Note however that the dataset named ```train.csv``` (Titanic dataset) is used in the section about dataframes; thus, if the notebook is intended to be used, make sure that the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook before running the cells.
* The notebook on lists and tuples doesn't import a dataset so the notebook can readily be used.
* The notebooks on dictionaries and sets, and arrays and vectors with NumPy, import the ```c2_epa_air_quality.csv``` dataset so should the notebooks are intended to be used, make sure that the dataset is in the same directory as the notebooks before running the cells. Additionally, the file ```ada_c2_labs.py``` is needed by the notebooks for testing purposes, so make sure that the file is included in the same directory.
* The notebook on dataframes with pandas imports two datasets: ```epa_ca_tx_pa.csv``` (546 rows, each representing AQI data from either California, Texas, or Pennsylvania) and ```epa_others.csv``` (1,179 rows, each representing data from a state that is not California, Texas, or Pennsylvania). In this regard, similar to the other notebooks, should the notebook is intended to be used, make sure that the datasets are included in the same directory before running the cells.
