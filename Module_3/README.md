# Module 3: Loops and strings

Here, you’ll learn how to use iterative statements, or loops, to automate repetitive tasks. You’ll also learn how to manipulate strings using slicing, indexing, and formatting. 

## Lesson objectives
* Describe how to manipulate strings using techniques such as concatenating, indexing, slicing, and formatting
* Summarize the syntax of the range() function
* Explain the purpose and logic of iterative statements such as for loops and while loops
* Format strings
* Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
* Introduce strings
* Know when to use for and when to use while loops
* Analyze nested for loops
* Use the range() function to control for loops
* Utilize for loops to iterate over sets of data, integers, strings and more
* Use loops within functions
* Identify common errors in loops
* Initialize variables
* Implement logical operators in while loops
* Define loops
* Define iteration

# About the files

* This part of the repository contains an annotated guide (as a Jupyter Notebook) for the module about loops (while loop and for loop) and strings, as well as hands-on activities (and exemplars for those activities) about the use of loops and strings.
* The activity on for loops imports a file called ```ada_c2_labs.py```, which is used to generate test cases so you can verify whether your code successfully completes the given tasks. In this regard, should the notebook on for loops (activity and exemplar) is intended to be used, make sure to have the ```ada_c2_labs.py``` in the same directory as the notebook.
* For the other notebooks on while loops and strings, just download the notebook and run the cells.
