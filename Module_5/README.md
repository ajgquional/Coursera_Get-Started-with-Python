# Module 5 description

You will put everything you have learned about Python so far into practice with an end-of-course project. You will select a business problem from a list of options and use the given data to solve the problem. This project is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and build a professional portfolio you can use to showcase your work to potential employers. 

## Lesson objectives
* Describe key findings for a relevant audience member
* Implement a code-based solution with Python
* Plan an approach to solving a new data science problem
* Conduct analysis on a given dataset to determine potential options for tackling a problem
* Formulate a problem statement to understand a dataset's inputs and outputs

# About the files

* This part of the repository contains the course project on Waze (the chosen project among the tree). The objective is to do preliminary inspection on the data using the skills learned in the course.
* Should the notebook is intended to be used, make sure to have the dataset named ```waze_dataset.csv``` in the same directory as the notebook.
