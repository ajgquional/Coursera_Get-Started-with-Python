# Module 2 description

Next, you’ll discover how to call functions to perform useful actions on your data. You’ll also learn how to write conditional statements to tell the computer how to make decisions based on your instructions. And you’ll practice writing clean code that can be easily understood and reused by other data professionals.

## Lesson objectives
* Explain the purpose and logic of conditional statements such as if, else, and elif
* Use comparators and logical operators to compare values
* List the benefits of commenting on code
* Identify best practices for writing clean code such as reusability, modularity, and refactoring
* Describe how to define Python functions using the def and return keywords
* Compare values using quality operators and logical operators
* Write comments and break code into blocks to reduce complexity
* Refactor code to enhance code readability and reuse
* Define and call functions utilizing parameters and return data
* Use data type conversions
* Differentiate and convert between different data types using variable expressions and built-in functions
* Define variables, expressions, operators
* Introduce basic python syntax

# About the files

* This part of the repository contains an annotated guide (as a Jupyter Notebook) for the module about functions and conditional constructs, as well as hands-on activities (and exemplars for those activities) about the use of functions and conditional constructs.
* No additional files (datasets) are needed to for the notebooks to work.
* Should the notebooks are intended to be used, just download the notebook and run the cells.
