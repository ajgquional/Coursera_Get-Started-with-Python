# Get Started with Python

## About the repository

* This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (annotated follow-along guides and activity exemplars) and relevant datasets in the Coursera course "Get Started with Python," the second course in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program. This repository is divided into "five modules" containing the files relevant to the module.
* The annotated guide (as a Jupyter Notebook) in each folder is used to follow-along the instructor in the course.
* The folder mainly contains the activity Jupyter notebooks (notebooks with a prefix "Activity") as well as "exemplars" (notebooks with a prefix "Exemplar") for those activities. The Exemplars are sample solutions, while the Activity Notebooks are my own solutions. I personally included both because in some of the activities, I have a different approach compared to what's in the Exemplar. This is to personally give me a reference on different approaches to solve a task.
* Some notebooks import datasets and additional files (which are also included in the folders). To know which notebook/s need an external data, refer to the inidividual README files within the folders. The datasets are important to be in the same directory as that of the notebook, since the cells in the notebook won't properly run if the specific dataset is not imported.
* All notebooks are originally created by the course developers, and it is just uploaded here mainly for reference to my personal study.
